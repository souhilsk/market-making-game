# Market-Making Game  

This project models competition between two market makers as a game-theoretic problem. Using Python simulations, we explore how bidâ€“ask spreads are set in a competitive environment and how factors such as volatility, order flow, and cost structures affect equilibrium strategies. The purpose of this repository is to provide a reproducible scaffold for financial engineering workflows, including data storage, reusable code in `src/`, and experiment notebooks in `notebooks/`.
